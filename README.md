The ECSC2018 gameplay aims to train you on the trade-offs of managing a successful cyber-security company in a competitive environment, while leveraging your technical, time management and tactical skills.

You will be playing the role of incident responders within a national cybersecurity company offering cybersecurity services to individual clients, private companies and public organisations. For each contract successfully completed, you will receive money and reputation. 

As in real life, you may sometimes choose to accept a contract from an NGO that needs help with fixing a broken CMS, while in other cases you may decide to sell 0-days to rogue governments. As in real life, your decisions have consequences. In the first instance, you may not be paid a lot, but you will earn yourself a solid reputation, while in the other, you may get cash, but miss future opportunities because of your choices. Indeed, certain contracts will require a minimum level of reputation. As in real life, some organizations just won’t do business with you if they don’t know you enough or if you have done too much business with the wrong people.

The team that will win the challenge will be the one with more cash in its wallet.
